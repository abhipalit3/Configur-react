### 3. **index.js**
- **Status**: New export file for trade rack components

## Key Adaptations for Trade Racks

âœ… **Base Class Adaptations**:
- **No Snap Lines**: `snapLineManager: null` since trade racks don't use snapping
- **No Geometry Manager**: Trade racks use `buildRack` utility instead of geometry managers
- **Custom Appearance**: Material-based appearance updates for rack components
- **Configuration Storage**: Uses `userData.configuration` instead of MEP data patterns

âœ… **Trade Rack-Specific Features**:
- Tier count and bay count controls
- Bay width configuration (feet/inches format)
- Tier height configuration (feet/inches format) 
- Position-based selection and movement
- Material-based visual feedback (blue for selected, green for hover)

âœ… **Enhanced Functionality**:
- Transform controls with keyboard shortcuts (W/E/R)
- Unified selection system with other components
- Consistent event handling architecture
- Storage integration for rack configurations

âœ… **Backward Compatibility**:
- All existing method calls preserved
- `selectedRack` â†’ `selectedObject` mapping
- `selectRack()`, `deselectRack()` methods maintained
- Global instance access maintained

## ðŸš¨ Trade Rack Differences from MEP Items

- **No Snapping**: Trade racks don't snap to geometry
- **No Tiers**: Trade racks don't use MEP tier system
- **Rebuild Pattern**: Trade racks rebuild entirely rather than updating geometry
- **Configuration Format**: Uses feet/inches format instead of pure metric
- **Storage**: May use different storage keys than MEP items

## âœ… Status: Complete

The trade rack system is now integrated with the base class architecture, providing:
- âœ… Significant code reduction while maintaining functionality
- âœ… Consistent behavior with other 3D components  
- âœ… Full backward compatibility
- âœ… New editor capability for basic rack configuration
- âœ… Ready for testing

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test

Your trade rack system is now operational with the unified architecture (adapted for non-MEP use case)!
